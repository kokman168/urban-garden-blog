## Frequently Asked Questions

## I can help you find information!  

Here's what you should know:

**Q: What can you do?**

A: As a large language model, I am trained on a massive dataset of text and code.  I can help you with many things, such as: 

* **Generating creative content:**  Stories, poems, articles, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
* **Answering your questions:** I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.
* **Translating languages:** I can translate text between many different languages.
* **Summarizing text:** Give me a long piece of writing and I can provide a shorter summary.
* **Coding:** I can help you with code in various programming languages.

**Q: What can't you do?**

A: While I'm very capable, there are some things I can't do:

* **Access real-time information:** I don't have access to the internet, so I can't provide information on current events or look up specific details online.
* **Give medical, legal, or financial advice:** I'm not a professional in these fields, so please consult with a qualified expert for advice.
* **Control physical devices:** I'm a text-based AI and can't interact with the physical world.
* **Have personal opinions or beliefs:** I'm an AI and don't have my own thoughts or feelings.

**Q: How do I use you?**

A: Simply type your request or question into the text box and I'll do my best to help!

**Q: What kind of data were you trained on?**

A: I was trained on a massive dataset of text and code compiled by the Gemma team. This dataset includes books, articles, websites, code repositories, and other publicly available information.
