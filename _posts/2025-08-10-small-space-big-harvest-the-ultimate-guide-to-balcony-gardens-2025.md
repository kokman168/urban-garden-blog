## Frequently Asked Questions

## Small Space, Big Harvest: The Ultimate Guide to Balcony Gardens (2025) - FAQ

**1. What kind of plants are best for balcony gardens?**

A balcony garden offers many options! Choose compact, slow-growing varieties of vegetables, herbs, and flowers.

* **Vegetables:** Tomatoes (cherry or patio), peppers, lettuce, spinach, radishes, strawberries
* **Herbs:** Basil, rosemary, thyme, chives, oregano
* **Flowers:** Petunias, marigolds, nasturtiums, geraniums

Consider your balcony's sun exposure and size when making your selection.

**2. Do I need a lot of space to grow food on my balcony?**

No! Even the smallest balconies can have a bountiful harvest. Utilize vertical space with trellises, hanging baskets, and tiered planters.  You can also grow vegetables in containers, such as bags, tubs, and even repurposed items like buckets.

**3. How much sunlight does a balcony garden need?**

Most vegetables and herbs thrive in at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. However, some plants, like lettuce and spinach, can tolerate partial shade. 

**4. What kind of potting mix should I use?**

Use a lightweight, well-draining potting mix specifically designed for containers. Avoid using garden soil, as it can become compacted in pots and impede drainage.

**5. How often do I need to water my balcony plants?**

Watering frequency depends on the plant type, weather conditions, and pot size. Check the soil moisture daily. Water thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry.
