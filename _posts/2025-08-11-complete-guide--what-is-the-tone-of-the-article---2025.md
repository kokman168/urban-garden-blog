I can create an article about urban gardening for small apartments. To ensure it hits the mark, I need a little more direction:

**Please tell me:**

* **Target Audience:**  Who are you writing for? (e.g., complete beginners, experienced gardeners with limited space, people interested in a specific type of gardening like herbs or vegetables) 
* **Focus:** What's the main takeaway? (e.g.,  Maximizing yield in small spaces? Beginner-friendly tips?  Preserving harvests in an apartment?)
* **Style:** Do you prefer a friendly, casual tone or something more informative and instructional?
* **Specific Tips:** Are there any particular techniques or tools you want to be sure I include? (e.g., vertical gardening, windowsill herb gardens, specific hydroponic systems)
